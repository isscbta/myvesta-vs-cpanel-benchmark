# 🚀 Benchmarking WordPress Hosting Environments

## 📝 Introduction

Welcome to our GitHub repository where we explore the performance of various WordPress hosting environments under different configurations.  
In this comprehensive benchmark study, we've analyzed the **responsiveness, reliability, and efficiency** of five distinct server setups using a variety of WordPress themes.  
Our aim is to provide insights that help developers and website owners make informed decisions when choosing a hosting environment for their WordPress sites.

## ⚙️ Server Configurations Tested

We compared the performance of the following server setups:

1. **WHM + cPanel + LiteSpeed Server**
2. **WHM + cPanel + LiteSpeed Server + LS Cache (default settings)**
3. **myVesta Hosting Panel**
4. **myVesta Hosting Panel + WP Rocket + rocket-nginx**
5. **myVesta Hosting Panel + W3TC + nginx**

> These configurations were tested across a range of WordPress themes, including free options like **Astra (Gutenberg)** and **Elementor**, as well as premium themes such as **Avada**, **Divi**, and **WP Bakery + Woodmart (WooCommerce)**.

## 🛠️ Benchmarking Tools & Why They Matter

To ensure a thorough analysis, we employed a diverse set of tools, each offering unique insights into different aspects of server performance:

- 🔸 **KeyCDN TTFB Tool**  
  *Measures Time To First Byte from global locations, reflecting server response speed and the impact of geographic latency.*

- 🔸 **Loader.io**  
  *Simulates concurrent traffic to assess server scalability and response under heavy load.*

- 🔸 **k6.io**  
  *Provides advanced performance metrics under stress, including request rates, success/failure counts, and server robustness.*

- 🔸 **WPPerformanceTester**  
  *Evaluates fundamental PHP and MySQL performance through common operations.*

- 🔸 **GTMetrix**  
  *Analyzes front-end performance with metrics like First Contentful Paint, Speed Index, and Total Blocking Time, giving a direct user experience perspective.*

## 🖥️ Server Specifications

All benchmarks were performed on the following hardware and software:

- **Server:** Hetzner-CCX22 (4 AMD dedicated vCPUs, 16 GB RAM, 160 GB SSD)
- **Location:** Falkenstein, Germany

**Software:**
- myVesta: `0.9.8-26-60` (Debian 12)
- cPanel: `116.07` (LiteSpeed 6.0.12 build 13, Rocky Linux 8.9)

## 📊 Analysis & Interpretation of Results

### ⚡ 1. Performance (TTFB, First Contentful Paint, Speed Index)

**⏱️ Time To First Byte (TTFB):**  
Across all tested themes and global locations, **myVesta consistently delivered lower TTFB values** compared to cPanel.  
For example:  
- Astra (Gutenberg) on myVesta: **187 ms** (Frankfurt)  
- cPanel with LiteSpeed: **507 ms** (Frankfurt)

This pattern repeats for all themes and regions, including Singapore and Sydney where myVesta stays under 800 ms while cPanel often exceeds 1 second.

> **Interpretation:**  
> myVesta’s default Nginx + PHP-FPM stack is highly optimized out of the box, delivering minimal server overhead and faster initial responses compared to cPanel (even with LiteSpeed). This directly boosts user experience and SEO.

---

**🎨 First Contentful Paint & Speed Index:**  
User-centric metrics also favor myVesta.  
- myVesta FCP with lightweight themes: **566 ms**  
- cPanel FCP: **915 ms**

Even with heavy themes (Avada, Divi), myVesta loads visible content in under 700 ms, while cPanel is frequently over 1 second.

> **Interpretation:**  
> Lower FCP and Speed Index result in a faster perceived website, leading to higher engagement and lower bounce rates.

---

### 🧩 2. Comparison by WordPress Theme Complexity

- **Lightweight Themes:**  
  myVesta dominates with lower TTFB and paint times, especially for remote visitors.
- **Heavyweight/Page Builder Themes:**  
  myVesta remains faster, with a noticeable advantage even for complex WooCommerce builds.

> **Interpretation:**  
> myVesta’s edge is clearest with simple themes but remains meaningful for demanding sites too.

---

### 🌍 3. Global Latency & CDN Use

- myVesta’s speed advantage is largest in Europe and the US, but remains substantial in Asia-Pacific regions.
- Paired with a CDN, myVesta’s low backend TTFB ensures even cache misses are much faster for all visitors.

> **Interpretation:**  
> myVesta is ideal for global projects where every user matters, no matter their location.

---

### 🧑‍💻 4. Other Observations

- **Consistency:**  
  myVesta shows stable, low response times across all test cases, while cPanel has more variability due to higher overhead.
- **Resource Efficiency:**  
  myVesta’s lean stack leaves more resources for PHP and MySQL, which is crucial under high load (e.g. WooCommerce stores).

---

## 🏆 Overall Conclusions

- **myVesta outperforms cPanel** (even with LiteSpeed and LSCache) in all key performance metrics, especially TTFB and content rendering speed.
- Differences are significant—faster TTFB and FCP mean better UX, conversion rates, and SEO.
- While cPanel can get close with extensive tuning and paid caching plugins, myVesta is faster and simpler out of the box.

> **Recommendation:**  
> If you want fast, efficient, and reliable WordPress hosting—with real, measurable benefits—**myVesta is the clear winner**.  
> Perfect for global audiences, WooCommerce stores, and performance-driven projects.
