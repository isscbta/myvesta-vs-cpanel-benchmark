# Benchmarking WordPress Hosting Environments: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to our GitHub repository where we explore the performance of various WordPress hosting environments under different configurations. In this comprehensive benchmark study, we've analyzed the responsiveness, reliability, and efficiency of five distinct server setups using a variety of WordPress themes. Our aim is to provide insights that help developers and website owners make informed decisions when choosing a hosting environment for their WordPress sites.

## Server Configurations Tested

We compared the performance of the following server setups:

1. WHM+cPanel+LiteSpeed Server
2. WHM+cPanel+LiteSpeed Server+LS Cache (Default settings)
3. myVesta Hosting Panel
4. myVesta Hosting Panel + WP Rocket + rocket-nginx
5. myVesta Hosting Panel + W3TC + nginx

These configurations were tested across a range of WordPress themes, including free options like Astra (Gutenberg) and Elementor, as well as premium themes such as Avada, Divi, and WP Bakery + Woodmart (WooCommerce).

## Benchmarking Tools and Why They Matter

To ensure a thorough analysis, we employed a diverse set of tools, each offering unique insights into different aspects of server performance.

### KeyCDN Tools for Time to First Byte (TTFB)

KeyCDN's TTFB testing tool was utilized to measure the responsiveness of our servers from various locations around the world. TTFB is a crucial metric as it directly impacts user experience by indicating the delay before the first byte of the server's response is received by the browser.

### Loader.io

Loader.io provided us with the ability to simulate traffic to our servers and measure how they perform under stress. This tool is essential for understanding the scalability of a hosting environment, highlighting its ability to manage large volumes of requests without compromising on speed or experiencing downtime.

### k6.io

k6.io was chosen for its comprehensive performance testing capabilities, which include measuring request times, success rates, and peak performance under load. By stress-testing our servers, k6.io helps us evaluate the robustness of caching mechanisms and the overall resilience of each hosting setup.

### WordPress Plugin - WPPerformanceTester

This plugin allowed us to measure the server's capability to execute fundamental operations like math calculations, string manipulations, loops, and conditionals. Additionally, it assessed the performance of MySQL operations, providing a well-rounded view of the server's efficiency.

### GTMetrix

GTMetrix offered a detailed analysis of front-end performance, including metrics like First Contentful Paint, Speed Index, and Total Blocking Time. These measurements are pivotal for understanding the user's visual experience and the site's speed from a visitor's perspective.

## Server Specifications

Our tests were conducted on a Hetzner-CCX22 server featuring 4 AMD dedicated vCPUs, 16GB RAM, and 160 GB SSD storage, located in Falkenstein, Germany. The software configurations were as follows:

- myVesta (Version: 0.9.8-26-60, OS: Debian 12)
- cPanel (Version: 116.07, LiteSpeed: 6.0.12 build 13, OS: Rocky Linux release 8.9)

## Insights and Conclusions

The results of our benchmarks, detailed in the accompanying Excel spreadsheet, offer a deep dive into the performance of each server configuration across different metrics and under various conditions. This data-driven approach allows us to compare the strengths and weaknesses of each setup, providing valuable insights into their suitability for different WordPress projects.
